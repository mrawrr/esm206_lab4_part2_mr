knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## create a new subfolder
- use new folder in files to create `figures`
- but git will only store the folder if there is a file inside it. 

## create a graph and save with `ggsave`

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = island)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = species))

```


#@ use `ggsave` as the last graph that was saved
- check the wd for a project by `here()` in the console
- we are using `here` to tell `ggsave` where the graph is being saved within that folder
- of course you can customize this


```{r}
ggsave(here("figures", "penguins_count.png"))
```
